<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example:</strong></div>
<div class="line">Illegal roleplayers discussing a drug cartel in real life and showing a video of a shootout with a “NSFW” spoiler would be acceptable, showing random gore for shock value is not.</div>

<div class="section" id="bugs-exploits">
<h3>Bugs &amp; Exploits<a class="headerlink" href="#bugs-exploits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you attempt to reproduce a bug to submit it to our bug tracker, please ensure you tell an administrator so you are not accidentally banned. Using the excuse of reproducing or testing a bug is not an acceptable unban reason if you failed to tell an administrator!</p>
</div>
<p>Users of OwlGaming may not abuse bugs, exploits, or otherwise use any scripts or part of OwlGaming in a capacity it was not intended to be used. Users are obligated to report any bugs or exploits they come across using our <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.owlgaming.net/">bug tracker</a>. If a bug or exploit occurs which grants or has the potential to grant users an unfair advantage, they should report that exploit or bug to an administrator as soon as possible in addition to submitting a ticket on our <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.owlgaming.net/">bug tracker</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">While playing in game you see a bug where some text is flickering. Text flickering does not give an unfair advantage, thus, you do not need to tell an administrator but should still report it on our bug tracker.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">During the process of moving items around in game, you accidentally duplicate a firearm. This clearly gives you an advantage. An administrator should be told and it should be reported on our bug tracker.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 3:</strong></div>
<div class="line">You move items around in game like in Example 2 and it only duplicates an item once. You cannot get it to happen again. While this series of actions does not give you an unfair advantage every time it occurs, it certainly has the potential to give you an unfair advantage and thus, an administrator should be told and it should be reported on our bug tracker.</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="english">
<h3>English<a class="headerlink" href="#english" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h3>Mixing Currencies<a class="headerlink" href="#mixing-currencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h3>Impersonations<a class="headerlink" href="#impersonations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h3>Always Roleplay<a class="headerlink" href="#always-roleplay" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Users of OwlGaming playing in game must remain in character at all times unless they are granted permission to go out of character by an administrator.</p>
<p><em>“Roleplay now,</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://owlgaming.net/support/">report</a> <em>later.”</em> is a phrase commonly used to describe this mindset.</p>

<div class="section" id="metagaming">
<h3>Metagaming<a class="headerlink" href="#metagaming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Users of OwlGaming are prohibited from metagaming. Metagaming is defined as using out of character information for in character purposes. Inciting others or attempting to metagaming is prohibited as well. Metagaming includes performing actions which are considered mixing.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith walks up to Tim Bloggins and sees the name above their head, then proceeds to call them by that name without ever having heard it in character. This is metagaming because John never found out Tim’s name in character.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith dislikes Tim Bloggins out of character because of a disagreement. John then refuses to roleplay with Tim on brand new characters because he dislike them out of character. This is not using out of character information for in character purposes excplicetly like reading someone’s name is in Example 1, however, it is mixing out of character feelings and influencing their character’s actions.</div>

<div class="section" id="powergaming">
<h3>Powergaming<a class="headerlink" href="#powergaming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Users of OwlGaming are prohibited from powergaming. Powergaming is defined as forcing your actions upon another player such as declaring your actions successful automatically or otherwise doing something unrealistic or roleplaying an action that is not possible. A player should generally be given the opportunity to respond to actions being taken against them in character. Certain skin combinations which are considered powergaming should be avoided, such as invisible arms, torso, floating body parts, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith walks up in front of Tim Bloggins and roleplays punching him, knocking him out. This is powergaming because Tim Bloggins was never given the opportunity to respond and the presumption that Tim would immediately be knocked out is unreasonable at face value. Similarly, if John Smith roleplayed ambushing Tim Bloggins with a baseball bat to the back of the head from behind, John Smith should still not assume they knock Tim Bloggins out, however, Tim should generally roleplay being knocked out or being incapacitated and severely injured if not dead. Failure to do so on Tim’s part would be powergaming against John.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith is restrained by Tim Bloggins using handcuffs. John Smith can still resist actions taken against himself in some capacity by wiggling around and such, however, it would be powergaming for him to outright state actions made against himself by Tim Bloggins would fail. For example, Tim Bloggins could grab John underneath his arms and drag him somewhere else. John Smith would be able to kick his feet and resist but ultimately, Tim Bloggins would succeed in normal circumstances.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 3:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith is struck by tazer prongs while running from police and incapacitated. He falls to the ground and responds with “/do The police would fail.” when the police attempt to roleplay cuffing John. Making such a /do constitutes powergaming. John Smith is already at a disadvantage physically and failing to explain why the police would fail in apprehending him is powergaming.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 4:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith drives a lowrider offroad at a high rate of speed and fails to roleplay damage. This is considered powergaming because the vehicle would not be able to sustain such conditions without breaking or becoming inoperable.</div>

<h4>Brawls<a class="headerlink" href="#brawls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>All physical altercations in character must be roleplayed. Default Grand Theft Auto physics and scripts for striking another player may be used if all players involved in the altercation agree to proceed using this method, otherwise known as a “brawl”.</p>

<div class="section" id="vehicular-collisions">
<h4>Vehicular Collisions<a class="headerlink" href="#vehicular-collisions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>All vehicle collisions which would result in injuries that would stunt the operation of the vehicle should be roleplayed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith is being chased by police. The police decide to perform a PIT maneuver on John in his vehicle to disable him from proceeding with his evasion. The PIT is semi-successful, however, John only spins out in the middle of the road without striking anything that would clearly disable the vehicle or injure him substantially causing him to halt. John does not need to roleplay spinning out as the physics of Grand Theft Auto portray the vehicle spinning out of control sufficently. This situation is also high paced and John stopping to type would result in him being surrounded by police and give the police an unfair advantage.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith is speeding down the road and hits a patch of dirt, causing him to swerve and side-swipe an electrical pole. The collision occurred at 30 MPH. In this instance, further RP is not necessary because the vehicle would not be disabled from a side-swipe nor would John receive more severe injuries than being jolted around or possibly receiving some bruising from the seatbelt. If, on the other hand, John had smashed his vehicle into a concrete bollard, that would clearly disable his vehicle and cause injuries which would halt the operation of the vehicle for a substantial period of time, thus, injuries, the collision, etc, should all be roleplayed.</div>

<h4>Character Development<a class="headerlink" href="#character-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The development of a character over time determines what they are capable of and inherently defines what is and is not powergaming.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith roleplays working out regularly in the gym and lifts weights in an attempt to become stronger. John, generally speaking, is stronger and more capable of physically overpowering someone else in an altercation than someone who has never roleplayed strength training before. This does not automatically mean that John can then run around beating people up without competition, however, in more nuanced situations where the strength of someone may become the determining factor in whether or not they succeed, this character development would comme into play.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith is part of a criminal gang. He is involved in a house robbery and sees a safe. Unable to break in with brute force, John suddenly decides his character has a history of being a locksmith and has the ability to crack safes. This not having been previously defined in John Smith’s character story and not having been roleplayed before means he is powergaming by saying he has this skill on a whim.</div>

<h3>Deathmatching<a class="headerlink" href="#deathmatching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

</div>
<div class="section" id="player-kills">
<h3>Player Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#player-kills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A player kill occurs when a character is killed, simulating unconsciousness and amnesia which extends as far back as that particular roleplay situation’s beginning. If a player is revived by an administrator to roleplay their wounds after being player killed, this does not reverse the amnesia effects unless an administrator specifically tells them the amnesia is voided for a particular reason. Player kills do not necessairly require a script death for the effects of a player kill to exist such as amnesia and severe injuries.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith goes to a bar in a bad part of town and meets a particularly violent drunk named Wilson LaRoche who while minding his own business, hits his girlfriend a few times. John Smith, being a white knight of the situation, tries to intervene. The two get into a physical altercation, and while Wilson is inebriated, he loses some self-control, kicking John Smith repeatedly in the face after he collapsed against an arcade machine. Slumped in the corner, John Smith is player killed where his health is depleted, and he is killed script-wise.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">James McGill roleplays falling 20 feet into the interstate off a bridge. Scriptwise, his fall does not take all of his HP, but from a roleplay perspective, he would clearly hit his head, causing him to go unconscious, resulting in amnesia and a severe brain injury or other injuries, making the fall by all practical means, a player kill. A secondary version of this example would be a sucker punch that knocks someone out, or a bat swung at the back of someone’s head in an ambush.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 3:</strong></div>
<div class="line">Miles Morrison is beat viciously by a group of thugs and loses consciousness, sustains a broken wrist and other bruising and cuts. Because this is a severe beating from a roleplay perspective and he lost consciousness, this situation for him is treated as a player kill, and he sustains the amnesia effect, and they are not required to “brawl” him and kill Miles through the script.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 4:</strong></div>
<div class="line">Harry Johnson is shot in the middle of a driveby shooting. He begins to lose blood after sustaining a gunshot wound to his arm and abdomen. He is not near a vehicle and begins to run to his house for the phone he left inside to call 911. He stumbles to the doorway and slumps down, still losing blood. A loss of blood causes unconsciousness, and eventually, he fails to reach his phone. In this instance, we can see how injuries that worsen over time such as being shot and losing blood may result in the same practical outcome as a player kill like when you are shot and lose all of your script health, but it is just on a longer time horizon.</div>

<p>No application is needed to player kill someone. Only a solid in character reason.</p>

<div class="section" id="roleplaying-after-a-player-kill">
<h4>Roleplaying After a Player Kill<a class="headerlink" href="#roleplaying-after-a-player-kill" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If a character is player killed and the scene is left after they respawn, the players involved should roleplay that the unconscious character is found by a good samaritan, emergency services were called, and they were taken to the hospital. The person that was player killed would then after they respawn at the hospital, roleplay in the hospital for a period of time for their injuries to heal and continue to roleplay those injuries accordingly.</p>
<p>Do not respawn and immediately run around as if nothing happened!</p>

<div class="section" id="character-kills">
<h3>Character Kills<a class="headerlink" href="#character-kills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A character kill occurs when a character is permanently killed and the ability to access that character is disabled VIA script function. Character kills serve as a means of permanently ending a character’s life and story. Character kills should not be taken lightly. Remember, a majority of situations can be dealt with before resorting to a character kill by beating, player kill, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith over time due to his addictive personality accumulated gambling debt from a local underground poker establishment. Weeks pass and John Smith fails to make consistent payments on the gambling debt, totaling $50,000. He is threatened and beat up but continues failing to pay his debt. The poker facility manager and crime boss decides to kill John Smith as retribution for not paying back the money and to send a message to the other people that owe him money that they should pay in a timely manner.</div>
</div>
<p>A sum of $50,000 is a substantial amount of money. If a smaller amount is owed, say, $10,000, a severe beating may be in order and perhaps the crime boss’ goons break into his house and steal stuff from him to get some payment and a loan would never be given to John Smith again because $10,000 would likely not warrant something as severe as murder.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>An application is necessary to character kill someone due to its severity. If a character kill application is sensitive, players may send make a private request which is sent to our Senior Administrators. Private character kills may be sent to Upper Administration members as well for the most privacy. Additionally, character kills may be accepted in game by a single Administrator for situations where a player requires a quick response and an application is otherwise too slow.</p>
<p>In order for a character kill to be valid, the character being killed should generally be killed script wise. There are a few types of exceptions to this. If for example someone’s foot is exposed and it is shot over and over and they die script wise, they would not necessarily realistically die. Thus, if they received reasonable medical treatment before they bled out, they’d survive and lose their foot. On the other hand, if that person hadn’t received prompt medical attention, they would bleed out and die, warranting a character kill even if they hadn’t died scriptwise. Another example of this would be if someone is run over by a vehicle. With the game physics, they may not lose very much health, but in reality, they would very easily be killed as a result of a high speed impact.</p>
<div class="section" id="character-kill-scenarios">
<h4>Character Kill Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#character-kill-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A character kill scenario is a scenario where character kills are issued to characters that die. These are common in roleplay events and large or serious situations and are often issued retroactively from the roleplay situation.</p>
<p>For a character kill scenario to be valid, there must be proof. An Administrator must witness the situation or there must be roleplay logs, a video, credible eye witnesses or comprehensive screen shots then shown to the handling Administrator. Character kill scenarios may happen at any time an Administrator deems necessary, thus, players should always be realistic and careful as they would in real life.</p>
<p>A character kill scenario may not necessarily be publicly mentioned to people involved to prevent metagaming where people shoot just to get a character kill where they otherwise wouldn’t have shot if they didn’t know them shooting someone was a guaranteed character kill on another player.</p>
<p>Below are some brief examples of character kill scenarios. They are by no means a comprehensive list showing the only situations you may be character killed but instead serve to give players a better idea of what the most common scenarios are.</p>
<div class="section" id="disregard-for-life">
<h5>Disregard for Life<a class="headerlink" href="#disregard-for-life" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Someone showing disregard for their own life or unnecessary risk such as acting suicidally or generally not caring for their actions as carefully as they would in real life. Below are some examples of disregard.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">Pulling a gun out on a police officer during a basic traffic top resulting in a citation.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">Reckless handling of a vehicle or aircraft and crashing it which would clearly result in death, especially at a very high rate of speed.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 3:</strong></div>
<div class="line">Police acting like they’re invincible, failing to follow proper safety protocol, or acting out unrealistically in situations where they normally wouldn’t.</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Please note, not all forms of disregard must or even should result in a character kill. The circumstances of the scenario and context matter greatly. If someone is resisting capture or kidnapping against 4 people, their chances of actually escaping and telling the police is slim to none which means if one of those 4 kidnappers is a hothead and shoots the person resisting capture, it should not be immediately deemed a character kill. The weight of their actions should be taken into account.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="organized-robberies">
<h5>Organized Robberies<a class="headerlink" href="#organized-robberies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Robberies which are organized, whether spur of the moment or heavily pre-planned are common circumstances in which a player (the robber) may be character killed. This includes heists, ammunation robberies, quick 24/7 robberies, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">John Smith is being robbed by Tim Bloggins, who is wielding a gun. Rather than give up the $100 John has in his wallet, he pulls out his own gun out and attempts to shoot Tim. Tim then shoots and kills John.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">A car of gang members burst into a convenient store to rob it. Inside is someone carrying a gun. Upon seeing the gang members aim a gun at the cashier, they draw their gun and manage to shoot two of the robbers and kill them.</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, just like with disregard for life, not all robbery related deaths have to be character kills. If robbers jump out of a van and aim guns at a woman on the side of the street, it is a normal, instinctive reaction for someone to immediately run at the first sight of a gun. If that woman is then shot in the back, her death wouldn’t be considered a character kill. If she, however, is cornered in an allyway for a moment with guns to her face and she tries to run or escape or physically resist, she’s had some time to think about the scenario and running isn’t a purely instinctual response at that point, thus, her death could be a character kill. (Though again, it could just as easily be a player kill too. Those do have severe consequences!)</p>
<p>In the case described above, where someone runs from a robbery and gets shot and player killed rather than character killed, this would be a form of disregard in a robbery context, thus, the player may still rob the unconscious (player killed) victim of their posessions to prevent players from abusing a player kill as a way out of a robbery.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="planned-or-supervised-events">
<h5>Planned or Supervised Events<a class="headerlink" href="#planned-or-supervised-events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Some events such as large fires, catastrophic weather, terrorist attacks, freak accidents, etc, are pre-planned or setup and supervised by admins. Some naturally occurring events become these types of large situations such as a large gang shootout, large pile-up car accident, and so on. During these types of events players may be eligible for a character kill as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">A plane crashes into a building where the fuel catches on fire and you are caught in the blaze.</div>

</div>
<div class="section" id="roleplaying-death">
<h5>Roleplaying Death<a class="headerlink" href="#roleplaying-death" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When any player roleplays death it may result in a character kill. A player cannot kill themselves or roleplay death and then have it appealed to come back, or try to roleplay coming back to life (unless assisted by CPR or defibrillators) within reasonable limits.</p>

<h5>Infiltrating Organizations<a class="headerlink" href="#infiltrating-organizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Characters that infiltrate an organization to gain intelligence, insiders knowledge, evidence, or any other means of information that could harm the survival of an organization. This clause focuses primarily on law enforcement infiltrating criminal organizations, but is applicable the other way around or with criminal organizations infiltrating each other as well.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">A detective joins a street gang to help police take them down. One of the gang members finds out and murders the detective.</div>

<div class="line"><strong>Example 3:</strong></div>
<div class="line">A criminal or informant joining the police department to gain knowledge for a gang. A detective with corruption that finds out they have been deceived in a blind rage one night kills the informant.</div>

</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="police-situations">
<h5>Police Situations<a class="headerlink" href="#police-situations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If a situation arises where the death of a police officer is justified by the hands of (a) criminal(s) due to serious ramifications that the player would suffer if caught, a character kill may be enforced for both parties. Police officers as a whole though are not character killed if they are simply doing their job. Character kills on police officers are also not justified if a player utilizes violence on a police officer to prevent themselves from being caught for less substantial crimes such as robbery, battery, drug dealing, weapon possession, etc. Players who escalate the level of force used against police officers cannot use that escalation to justify a character kill. An example of this will be below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 1:</strong></div>
<div class="line">A criminal is fleeing police custody for a drug charge. If they shoot at police to escape this, it wouldn’t be a character kill because the punishment they are fleeing from is not essentially life threatening like life in prison would be for murder. If the criminal fleeing police for a drug charge shoots at the police, even though this was escalated to potentially attempted murder, a character kill wouldn’t be valid because the escalation was done by the fleeing party. Forcing a character kill on the officer at this point would mean that the vast majority of police deaths like this are character kills which is unsustainable.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 2:</strong></div>
<div class="line">A criminal has an arrest warrant out on them for murder which would result in life in prison. The player shoots at the police officer to prevent the officer from identifying and arresting them so they may escape. The police officer may be killed in this situation where substantial stakes are at risk. Foreknowledge is a mitigating factor in this circumstance. If the officer did not know there was an arrest warrant for murder, the chances of them being character killed are reduced. If they did know they had an arrest warrant on them for murder, the chances are increased.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Example 3:</strong></div>
<div class="line">During a gun deal where a high-level gang leader is involved a police officer pulls up on them. In order to protect the identity of the high-level gang leader and prevent an investigation which could cripple the gang, everyone flees and a few of the gang members at the deal shoot at the police officer, killing them.</div>

<p>Factions may have a character kill clause that players inherently take upon themselves by associating with those factions. These factions are generally illegal ones.

This limitation, however, is not to be used as a “safe zone”. The zones listed below include all of their reasonable surrounding perimiters.</p>
<p>If, as an example, you are being chased by an attacker and run onto the steps of a police station, this does not mean they must suddenly stop all illegal activity. Instead, everyone involved should roleplay a realistic police presence. In this case, a police officer at the front desk of a police lobby would assist the person being attacked. If there is a disagreement on the details of how the roleplay would proceed, contact an administrator.</p>

<p>All private residential property may be broken into and burglarized at any time except when the owner of the property is logged out inside the interior or when another player logged out of the interior within the last 7 days. When the request is made at least two law enforcement officers must be available to respond. Residential refers to a style of property that is designed for people to live in, not including recreational vehicles, boats, and other simlar enterable vehicles.</p>
<p>Properties that are not strictly commercial nor residential (home garages being the most common) which are attached to or immediately adjoining a residential property on the same piece of land and owned by the same person fall under this 7 day exception despite not being strictly residential (livible). A common example of this would be the garages next to houses in Paleto Bay or garages attached to mansions in Vinewood.

<h4>Vehicle Robbery<a class="headerlink" href="#vehicle-robbery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Vehicle robbery means a robbery of a vehicle without moving the vehicle itself in any substantial way. They do not require the owner to be online and are treated like faction or government property robberies, however, government vehicles require permission from an administrator to be broken into.</p>
<p>Note: Substantial vehicle movement effectively means moving the vehicle far enough that the owner would not be able to find it. An example of moving a vehicle in a non-substantial way is towing it from a parking space to a nearby allyway for the purpose of further concealing the robbery of the interior of the vehicle and leaving it afterward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vehicle-theft">
<h4>Vehicle Theft<a class="headerlink" href="#vehicle-theft" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Vehicle theft refers to actually taking and moving the vehicle in question a substantial distance, usually for the purpose of making a profit off the vehicle or using it at a later date. This may only be done or attempted once every 24 hours. Government vehicles require permission from an administrator. An exception to this is a spontaneous vehicle pursuit and the government vehicle in question is co-opted.</p>
<p>If the key is in the inventory of a vehicle, you may steal the car without admin permission. If the ignition key is digitally signed, an NPC locksmith will not copy the key without proof of vehicle ownership (vehicle title &amp; accompanying ID). In order for a player locksmith to copy the key, they must roleplay gathering the appropriate tools and key blanks to do the digital copying themselves.</p>
<p>If the player timed out you may not steal their vehicle, an admin can check connection logs to determine if the player timed out or not.</p>

<div class="section" id="donator-pets">
<h3>Donator Pets<a class="headerlink" href="#donator-pets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pets should be treated realistically, particularly in situations involving conflict roleplay.</p>
<p>For instance, it is reasonable to assume that you could tell your dog to sit, stay, and lay down. It would also be reasonable to assume that a pet could defend its owner if they are being attacked, provided the animal is capable of doing so (a dog might, a cormorant wouldn’t) if the owner decides to roleplay that. It would not be reasonable to assume that you could command your dog to attack someone, or perform another specialized task like that without putting a fair amount of time and energy into training the pet.</p>
<div class="section" id="injury-death">
<h4>Injury &amp; Death<a class="headerlink" href="#injury-death" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Pets are treated like players when it comes to injuries and death. In order to seriously injure or debilitate a pet (a player kill equivalent), you must have a solid in character reason. The injuries incurred should then be treated by a veterinarian, just like a player would be treated at the hospital for their injuries. An administrator may decide to permanently kill (a character kill basically) a pet if the circumstance is dire enough, or it is warranted based on the roleplay at hand. This is far more likely in situations where a retaliation against a player by targeting their pet is valid or in circumstances where a player decides to endanger their pet through roleplay such as their pet defending them, attacking someone else, or something similar.</p>
<p>If a pet is considered to have died, kidnapped, or put in similar circumstances where the player is no longer able to roleplay the use of their pet normally, they can roleplay buying a new pet and enjoy the usage of the donator perk still. Essentially, no in character action taken against a pet can deprive someone of using their donator perk.</p>

<div class="line"><strong>F1</strong></div>
<div class="line">The “<strong>F1</strong>” key is fairly self explanatory. Here you can browse servers, check client settings, etc. If you have an issue where you need to reconnect, this is the place to do it by joining through the server browser and searching “Owl” or by direct connecting. The latter is recommended.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>F2</strong></div>
<div class="line">The “<strong>F2</strong>” is generally referred to as the “help center” or variations thereof. This is considered by many to be the heart of the F key menus because it contains the reporting interface to ask questions, request help, or report a player if need be. It also contains general information about the server such as a roleplay overview and a list of commands available in the server for quick referencing.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>F3</strong></div>
<div class="line">When you hit “<strong>F3</strong>” you’ll get the faction menu, if you’ve joined a faction. Here you’ll see a faction roster, the message of the day, financial information, and other useful stuff for managing a faction. This in general is not used immediately in the server, however, we highly encourage new players to find a faction to start roleplaying with as soon as possible. Doing a legal job with others and roleplaying is an ideal way to get started in the server!</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>F4</strong></div>
<div class="line">The “<strong>F4</strong>” menu is our donation panel where you’ll be able to manage the perks you can buy with GameCoins. There are a variety of things you can purchase with varying effects. Be sure to read each feature carefully so you understand what it does. Some, for example, apply to your character, or your account, or when applied it is for a limited period. After the time ends the perk will expire and you will have to repurchase it. Other perks like stat transfers are permanent one time purchases.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>F5</strong></div>
<div class="line">Our keybind manager can be found by pressing “<strong>F5</strong>”. Here you can modify all of our custom controls and assign custom binds to a key which is specific to your account and or character, depending on what you choose. A common example of this would be binding “NUMPAD1” to “/me lifts his shirt, revealing a pistol in his front waistline, pulling it out quickly.”</div>
</div>
<p>If you save this and then press “<strong>NUMPAD1</strong>” a /me will display like this.</p>

<h3>Map &amp; GPS<a class="headerlink" href="#map-gps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To find out where you are press “<strong>ESC</strong>” to bring up your map. Click on your map once and it will show a list of locations on the right. You can double click anywhere on the map to set a GPS marker. Use your scroll wheel to zoom in and out on the map.</p>
<p>On the right side of your map, you’ll be able to find a legend specifying all the icons and what they are. You can scroll through that list with your scroll wheel (if clicked on once) and with your arrows up and down. Your map will, if you switch through icons, automatically focus the selected icon. Much like in GTA Online, you can then hit enter to put a waypoint marker on said icon.</p>
<p>There are a variety of markers but the most important ones starting out will be the “G” marker for the “<strong>Paleto Bay DMV</strong>” and “<strong>Paleto Bay Autos</strong>” if you’re in Paleto Bay, or “<strong>Los Santos County Hall</strong>” and “<strong>Premium Deluxe Motorsport</strong>” if you’re in Los Santos. You can get your driving license at the county hall and purchase a vehicle at the dealership.

<h3>Making Money<a class="headerlink" href="#making-money" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You’ll want to make money to buy all of the accoutrements life could offer you in wonderful San Andreas. To do this as a new player, we recommend you join a faction and or do some of the scripted jobs we have made available. There currently are…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bus Driver</li>
<li>Taxi Driver</li>
<li>Mailman</li>
<li>Trash Collector</li>
<li>Delivery Driver</li>
<li>Trucker</li>
<li>Graffiti Cleaner</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the jobs involving heavy vehicles will require a heavy vehicle license. Be sure to check which license you need for each job by speaking to the job NPC of your choice. The motorbike license is <strong>$50</strong>, car license is <strong>$75</strong> and the heavy vehicle license is <strong>$100</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="banking-spending-money">
<h4>Banking &amp; Spending Money<a class="headerlink" href="#banking-spending-money" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There are references throughout the script that state “<strong>p/m</strong>” meaning paycheck per month. This reference to your paycheck being monthly does not mean a real life month. A paycheck is hourly.</p>
</div>
<p>After you make your money, you’ll want to collect it, bank it, or spend it! When you get paid, your money will come in the form of a paycheck every hour. This money is direct deposited into your account so you don’t have to worry about carrying around large amounts of cash as you do your job and get paid. You may check how long until your next paycheck by typing “<strong>/payday</strong>”. Once you receive a payday, you can view the details of your paycheck by doing “<strong>/showpayday</strong>”.</p>
<p>Any ATM you find functions like a bank where you can deposit, withdraw, or wire transfer money to other players. Each player also receives state benefits totaling <strong>$500</strong>. If you make a gross income of over <strong>$1,000</strong> then your state benefits will end until that number is lowered to below that threshold. This regular income in conjunction with a job you have will help you afford your first home or vehicle on credit, meaning you can make an initial down payment on a vehicle then pay it off over the course of multiple paychecks, rather than have to save up enough money to buy that home or vehicle outright in cash.</p>
<p>You’ll want to go to a convenience store at a gas station or 24/7 and check out what items they are offering. The most important thing to acquire is a cellphone. This will allow you to call a taxi to come pick you up and communicate with other characters by calling them or call 911 if you have an emergency!</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">An example of the property purchase interface.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The above image shows the housing purchasing interface. On the left blue rectangle you choose who is buying the house. Here, if you are a faction, you can choose a faction, otherwise, you would choose yourself. Next, you can choose to purchase with cash, credit, or a token, which will be explained further below. If buying in cash, you will need to pay for the full cost of the house. If paying in credit, you will need to pay an initial down payment then continue to make monthly payments in character of the stated amount. One monthly payment occurs every in game hour.</p>
<div class="section" id="token-vehicles-houses">
<h5>Token Vehicles &amp; Houses<a class="headerlink" href="#token-vehicles-houses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Every character starts out with a vehicle and house token. These tokens are effectively vouchers, that allow you to redeem them for one vehicle and house for free. The vehicle you can get is anything in the token vehicle category whereas the house you may get is anything up to a value of <strong>$50,000</strong>. This means that any new player can start roleplaying from day one without having to do a script job if they don’t want. For example, someone wanting to roleplay a school teacher should not have to drive a garbage truck around to make money if they don’t want to.</p>
<p>This allows everyone in the server to get closer to that average middle-class level which affords a lot of roleplay opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Note, please don’t forget to “/park” your vehicle where you intend for it to respawn after purchasing it. It is also wise to “/park” your vehicle after you drive around for a bit and plan to stay somewhere for any length of time to ensure it does not respawn elsewhere when you didn’t want it to.</strong></p>

<h3>Next Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your next steps would be to roleplay! Check out the server, interact with the characters and players, get a feel for how things work, and check out our other <a class="reference external" href="https://forums.owlgaming.net/forum/197-guides-faqs/">guides</a>. We highly recommend if you are new to roleplay to check out our basic and advanced roleplay tutorials. They’ll help you get a feel for how we roleplay here and better understand some of the core concepts to have the best possible experience.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that you look for other players to roleplay with, specifically factions. Factions are a great way to interact with other players AND make good money.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This lore exists to provide a basic framework on the history of San Andreas as a whole. The information below is considered readily available in character.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="founding-history">
<h3>Founding &amp; History<a class="headerlink" href="#founding-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>San Andreas is currently the 51st state of the United States of America, located in the northern Caribbean, south of Florida and north of Cuba, slightly eastward, with an approximate population equal to that of Northern California, 15 million. San Andreas was originally inhabited by a native population, which no longer exists, named the “Andreans” by the Spanish after the island was found by Christopher Columbus in 1492 during his exploration of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>After Christopher Columbus’ exploration of San Andreas and the surrounding Caribbean islands, the Spanish sent ships to colonize the state, which at the time, was considered a territory of Spain, specifically to take advantage of its fertile grounds and ideal climate for sugar cane and coffee farming, much like the French did with Hati in 1625. This colonial control resulted in San Andreas becoming one of the wealthiest colonies under Spanish control.</p>
<p>Due to rampant piracy in the Caribbean area from the 16th Century to the early 19th Century, the Spanish formed several partnerships with the United States and private sailing companies to combat this piracy. This resulted in a series of mutual aid agreements later called the “Sugar Accords” by historians which were the precursors to the eventual sale of San Andreas to the United States in 1829, just as piracy in the Caribbean was being eradicated.</p>
<p>Long after the sale of San Andreas in 1829 to the United States, several trade agreements remained, resulting in half of all sugar production being exported to Spain while the United States enjoyed a monopoly on the island of exclusive and fine coffee varieties. This notably includes a variation of the famous Blue Mountain coffee variety from the Blue Mountains of Jamacia. This San Andreas variety grows on and around Mountain Chiliad, giving it the name Chiliad Mountain coffee, one of the most profitable crops to this day after its introduction in 1854 to the island.</p>
<p>From 1920 to 1933, the United States enacted a nationwide ban on the production, importation, sale, or transportation of alcohol. This led to a rise in crime related to circumventing these laws. San Andreas played a key role in continuing to produce and export alcohol to the mainland United States, primarily in the form of rum from the vast amounts of sugarcane byproducts the island had at its disposal. During this period, the United States Federal Government attempted several times to raid various production facilities in San Andreas but failed due to rampant corruption in the state as a whole. Historians draw a parallel between this and the modern-day drug trade in Central and South America where politicians are regularly paid off or directly involved in and benefiting from the cartels who produce and export these illicit goods.</p>
<p>Many organized crime groups currently in San Andreas can draw many of their roots back to this period where fortunes were amassed or lost overnight and smuggling routes were established.</p>
<div class="section" id="los-santos-county">
<h4>Los Santos County<a class="headerlink" href="#los-santos-county" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The county of Los Santos was founded in 1829 as part of the sale to the United States and was established as the first and only county-wide government in the state. This status remains to this day due to the size of the island.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="los-santos-city">
<h4>Los Santos City<a class="headerlink" href="#los-santos-city" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The city of Los Santos, located in the southern portion of the island, was the first municipality and currently remains the largest in the entire state, founded in 1522 as one of the first locations original colonizers settled. There are several historical sites that are also attributed to the early settlers of San Andreas, however, of those original locations, Los Santos city is the only remaining one.</p>
<p>An infamous culture surrounds the city of Los Santos as over the years there has been an attempt to attract entertainment personalities to Vinewood, an imitation Hollywood. This imitation led to a bizarre subculture of America, often described as “Hollywood on steroids” where people continuously try to one-up each other to gain attention in the tabloids. These Vinewood superstars are often seen as the weird rejects of Hollywood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="los-santos-county-sheriff-s-department">
<h4>Los Santos County Sheriff’s Department<a class="headerlink" href="#los-santos-county-sheriff-s-department" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As part of the creation of the county in 1829, the Los Santos County Sheriff’s Department was founded as the original law enforcement for the county and ultimately the state. Like many territories and states, the original law enforcement entities found themselves operating as Sheriff’s Deputies or U.S. Marshals depending on the jurisdiction. Today, the state of San Andreas and its subsequent law enforcement structure are indistinguishable from other modern law enforcement practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="los-santos-county-fire-department">
<h4>Los Santos County Fire Department<a class="headerlink" href="#los-santos-county-fire-department" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A centralized county Fire Department was founded, known as the Los Santos County Fire Department, in 1850 after a series of wildfires had crippled the agriculture of the state. Many areas of the state are infertile or dry now as a result of overplanting and draining the soil of its natural resources. This dry climate results in severe brush fires and wild fires that commands the attention of the Fire Department regularly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prominent-industry">
<h3>Prominent Industry<a class="headerlink" href="#prominent-industry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The island produces a vast quantity of sugar and its related byproducts such as molasses and rum. Coffee is also a large industry in San Andreas as well as tequila from blue agave plants which are favored crops on the island resulting from the hospitable environment. There are a multitude of fisheries throughout the island, bringing in large quantities of fish for consumption and exportation.</p>
<p>Tourism is one of the largest industries in the state. Clear blue waters, lots of outdoor activities and a mild climate result in millions of tourists yearly as well as several ports for some of the largest cruise lines like Carnival and the Royal Caribbean. Tourists come from all over to visit the infamous “Vinewood Hills” and check out the bizarre culture fostered by actors, directors, and other entertainment personalities looking to strike it big.</p>
